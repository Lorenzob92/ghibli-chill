**Ghibli Chill** is a cozy, lo-fi productivity workspace inspired by Studio Ghibli aesthetics, designed to help you focus with ambient vibes and minimal distractions.

## ✨ Features

- **Lo-fi Music Playlists:** Choose between curated lo-fi and jazz chill tracks to set the perfect study/work mood.
- **Ambient Sounds:** Layer calming rain, campfire, or coffee shop sounds over your music for deeper immersion.
- **Ghibli Video Overlay:** Pull the lamp switch to activate a beautiful Ghibli-inspired video loop with VHS film grain effects.
- **Timed Task List:** Track your tasks with time logging and export your completed work to CSV for productivity reports.

## 🛠️ How It Works

Ghibli Chill is a web application built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). It uses client-side JavaScript to:
- Play and loop background music and ambient sounds with synchronized volume controls.
- Toggle a full-screen Ghibli video overlay with blend mode effects for aesthetic vibes.
- Manage the to-do list state using the browser's `localStorage`.
- The user interface is built with Astro components and styled with CSS for a warm, nostalgic aesthetic.

## 🚀 Getting Started (for Developers)

Want to run Ghibli Chill locally or contribute to the project? Follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (or `pnpm`, `yarn`)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lorenzob92/ghibli-chill.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ghibli-chill
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the application, typically on `http://localhost:4321`. The server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so changes to your code will be reflected in the browser instantly.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the site, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
The optimized static files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- More music playlist options (ghibli OST tracks, ambient piano).
- Customizable color themes (dark mode, warm sepia, cool blue).
- Advanced timer features (custom durations, pomodoro cycles).
- More ambient sound options (forest, ocean waves, library ambiance).
